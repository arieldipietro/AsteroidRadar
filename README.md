# Purpose of this Folder

This folder should contain the scaffolded project files to get a student started on their project. This repo will be added to the Classroom for students to use, so please do not have any solutions in this folder.

## Note: Android Kotlin Gradle Update
Use the updated Gradle version in the `~/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file:
```
distributionUrl = https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-6.1.1-all.zip
```
REGARDING THE API:
Please use your own API Key, since it's highly unsafe (and often breaks the Terms of Service) to include API keys in public repos.
API KEY can be obtained in https://api.nasa.gov/
Once an APIkey has been obtained, copy it in the file AsteroidRadar/app/src/main/java/com/udacity/asteroidradar/Constants.kt
